This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.6.

Application fetching API from https://dog.ceo/dog-api/documentation/ to create a list of dog breeds to select from and show a random image of that breed along with a link to wikipedia's article on it.

Unfortunately I wasn't able to finish the part of the task that required showing the dog image, part of the code responsible for it has been commented out.
